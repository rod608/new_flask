            <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/#what-is-git" target="_blank">GitHub Docs: Repositories</a>

            <p class="mt-3">Time to learn about Git, GitHub, & Repositories. Git is a version control software, GitHub is the company that developers make use of cloud-based Git repositories, and Repositories
                are the storage locations for your previous software archives in your version control process (where your projects are stored)!
            </p>

            <p>Alright, so what is version control? Just as it sounds, it's a safe way to save changes in your code over periods of time without having to overwrite previous versions; in case you have to go back
                to it later on for some reason. Git counts as distributed version control, meaning each individual developer working with a repository has a copy of it; this is better as centralized as that one entails
                the "main" project being somewhere specific. Overall, you can expect to initialize or clone a repository, add your changes, commit a snapshot of your code, and push (if you're working alone on a small project,
                that is)!
            </p>

            <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit" target="_blank">GitHub Docs: Commits</a>

            <p class="mt-3">A commit is can be compared to a snapshot of your repository at a specific time.</p>

            <p>Commits are made after implemented major changes, or even minor ones that hold some sort of value. The point of implementing version control at all is being able to go back to a previous
                state if things were to go wrong down the line. Of course, you have to add (git add) the files you've updated to the stage before attempting to commit. You can commit with or without a message,
                but it's good practice to include one.
            </p>

    <!-- Branches -->
    <section id="branches">
        <h3 class="mb-0 pb-0">Branches</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-branches" target="_blank">GitHub Docs: Branches</a>

            <p class="mt-3">Instead of pushing straight to main, create a branch. Branches are contained areas of your repository that allow for safely modifying code before without making changes to the "main" or "master" branch.</p>

            <p>We all know what "pushing" is in GitHub, although there's a good chance that you've only experienced pushing to "main" or "master", which are branches themselves.
                In reality, this is an awful habit. Think of it this way: When working with a team of developers, everyone will be delegated their own "feature" to implement. Let's say
                a team member completed their feature, but they unknowingly pushed to the "main" or "master" branch. In that scenario, the possibility of a mass code breakage arises.
                The predicament could have been easily avoided if the team member had created a new branch and tested his work from there, before eventually merging to the main branch.
                Let's get into merging:

    <!-- Merging -->
    <section id="merging">
        <h3 class="mb-0 pb-0">Merging</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request" target="_blank">GitHub Docs: Merging</a>

            <p class="mt-3">After testing your code in the sub-branch, you're ready to merge. Merging entails piecing together the sub-branches back into the main one, which unifies the code once again.</p>

            <p>Ok, so merging isn't as clear as I made it to be above. You may not be ready to merge after confirming your code is safe as it's best to fetch remote commits, and possibly implement
                a fast-forward merge instead of a regular one.
            </p>

    <!-- Tags -->
    <section id="tags">
        <h3 class="mb-0 pb-0">Tags</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/managing-tags" target="_blank">GitHub Docs: Tags</a>

            <p class="mt-3">Tags in GitHub are similar to comments made in code; they're useful for annotation purposes.</p>

            <p>As tags are associated with commits, you can think of them as a different form of "message" attached to the commit. If you use one, it should be useful information. For Example,
                you may have a tag to signify a new version of your software; whether it be major or minor. It's just like those Windows updates you see often; they have specific "version" names
                if you look carefully in settings.
