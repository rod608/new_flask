               target="_blank">Digital Ocean: Definition</a>

            <p class="mt-3">Just like Inheritance, the Single-Responsibility Principle is one that is fairly
                self-explanatory. To sum it up nicely, the principle states that each class should do one thing; and do
                it well. This way, changes in one place can impact everything in a good way. Troubleshooting will also
                become a breeze as there's only one place where a specific thing could go wrong. Just taking a look at
                how the Calculator project's file system is set up shows how it's following this principle. Every major
                thing is its own class and it does its function well.</p>

               target="_blank">Digital Ocean: Definition</a>

            <p class="mt-3">The Open-Closed Principle is also fairly simple; though it is not as transparent as the
                last. This principle states that completed classes should be open for extension but not for
                modification, as you don't want to drastically change how it behaves. This means that adding some sort
                of new feature is allowed as long as it follows the principles and isn't changing any functional
                behaviors.</p>

               target="_blank">Digital Ocean: Definition</a>

            <p class="mt-3">Object-Oriented Programming represents real-world relations better than any spaghetti code
                ever could. Classes like the aforementioned Calculator class have properties and methods; just like the
                ones in real life. Well, the principle that is Inheritance plays a big role in solidifying the
                real-world aspects of object-oriented programming by introducing tied relationships. As the name
                suggests, Inheritance allows for one class to inherit from another. The "child" class inherits all the
                properties and methods from the parent class and adds its own, meaning the child is dependent on the
                parent. For example, it would make sense to have a Yorkie class extend a Dog class, seeing as though
                Yorkies share many similarities with other dogs but throw their own characteristics and classiness into
                the mix. Let's see if we can find an example of this within the Calculator code:
                tuple() method that's used within the
                calculator code as an example: </p>

            <img src="../static/images/articles/oopP_4.png" alt="Calculator Class (history)"
                 class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-50 mb-2">

            <p>Though it is an abstract class, we can see the parent class Calculation and the factory method it uses to
                push out children. Calculation can't be instantiated as it is abstract, but it's children will have
                access to that constructor that is seen there for instantiation as well as any properties/methods that
                it may have. This parent class can have multiple children, but the children can only have one parent.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3">Polymorphism is synonymous for having multiple forms. Let's say that you had two classes
                that had methods with identical header signatures but with different behaviors: Putting them into some
                sort of array and calling that method should return the correct operation for each of those objects.
                This is due to the fact that the compiler knows exactly where to call it from, meaning this ties in
                nicely with the concept that is Encapsulation. Let's see if we can find an example of this within the
                Calculator code:
                tuple() method that's used within the
                calculator code as an example: </p>

            <img src="../static/images/articles/oopP_5.png" alt="Calculator Class"
                 class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-50 mb-2">

            <p>The image above shows two separate classes, Multiplication and Subtraction, that have a method named
                getResult() with the exact same header. The method for Multiplication multiplies before returning and
                the behavior for Subtraction's getResult() method should be obvious. That being said, the compiler would
                be able to discern which getResult() is being called depending on which class the object being used to
                access the method is an instance of.
